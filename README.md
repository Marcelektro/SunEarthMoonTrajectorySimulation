# Sun-Earth-Moon Trajectory Simulation

A program to simulate the trajectory of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.  
We assume Sun and Earth and Earth and Moon are in circular orbits.  

The simulation is based on the following equations of motion:

- `G = 6.67430e-11` — gravitational constant
- `M_sun = 1.989e30` — mass of the Sun
- `M_earth = 5.972e24` — mass of the Earth
- `M_moon = 7.347e22` — mass of the Moon
- `R_earth_sun = 1.5e8` — distance between Earth and Sun
- `R_earth_moon = 384400` — distance between Earth and Moon  

_(provided by the task description)_

Simulation is performed using Improved Euler (MidPoint) method.

Implemented in C.
